# Claude Code Session Log

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Project:** Zwift Scout - DuckDB Rider Database

---

## Session Start

**User:** hello

**Claude:** Hello! I'm ready to help you with your Zwift e-cycling database project. What would you like to work on?

---

## Planning Phase: POST /riders Endpoint to raw.duckdb

**User:** let's start really simple, getting the riders table into raw from the post riders endpoint into the ./data/raw.duckdb database

**Claude:** Explored project structure and presented plan:

### Plan: Load Riders from POST /riders endpoint into raw.duckdb

**What we'll create:**

1. **./data/** directory - for storing DuckDB databases

2. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies:
   - `dlt[duckdb]` - data loading tool with DuckDB support
   - `httpx` - HTTP client for API requests

3. **zwift_scout/zr_riders_pipeline.py** - Main pipeline script:
   - Decrypt and load `ZRAPP_API_KEY` from environment
   - Create a dlt source function that calls POST /riders endpoint with list of rider IDs
   - Configure dlt to load data into `./data/raw.duckdb`
   - Handle the response JSON and yield it for dlt to process
   - Include test rider IDs: [4598636, 5574, 5879996]

4. **Test execution** - Run the pipeline with test data to verify it works

**Key technical details:**
- Use `httpx.post()` with 30s timeout
- Headers: `{"Authorization": ZRAPP_API_KEY}`
- Endpoint: `https://zwift-ranking.herokuapp.com/public/riders/`
- Payload: JSON list of integers (rider IDs)
- DLT will auto-create schema and handle incremental loads

**Status:** Plan approved by user

---

## Implementation Phase

### Task 1: Create data directory
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Action:** Created `./data/` directory using `mkdir -p ./data`

### Task 2: Create requirements.txt
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Action:** Created `requirements.txt` with dependencies:
```
dlt[duckdb]
httpx
```

### Task 3: Create zr_riders_pipeline.py
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Action:** Created `/home/robgriffin247/vibe_code/zwift_scout/zr_riders_pipeline.py`

**Code:**
```python
import os
import httpx
import dlt


@dlt.source
def zwift_riders_source(rider_ids: list[int]):
    """
    DLT source that fetches rider data from ZwiftRacing POST /riders endpoint.

    Args:
        rider_ids: List of Zwift rider IDs to fetch
    """

    @dlt.resource(write_disposition="replace")
    def riders():
        """Fetch riders data from the ZwiftRacing API."""
        api_key = os.getenv("ZRAPP_API_KEY")
        if not api_key:
            raise ValueError("ZRAPP_API_KEY environment variable not set")

        header = {"Authorization": api_key}
        base_url = "https://zwift-ranking.herokuapp.com/public/"

        response = httpx.post(
            f"{base_url}riders/",
            headers=header,
            json=rider_ids,
            timeout=30
        )
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Yield the response data
        data = response.json()
        yield data

    return riders


def run_pipeline(rider_ids: list[int] = None):
    """
    Run the DLT pipeline to load rider data into DuckDB.

    Args:
        rider_ids: List of rider IDs to fetch. Defaults to test IDs.
    """
    if rider_ids is None:
        # Default test rider IDs
        rider_ids = [4598636, 5574, 5879996]

    # Create pipeline with DuckDB destination
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
        pipeline_name="zwift_riders",
        destination=dlt.destinations.duckdb("./data/raw.duckdb"),
        dataset_name="zr_raw"
    )

    # Run the pipeline
    load_info = pipeline.run(zwift_riders_source(rider_ids=rider_ids))

    print(f"Pipeline completed: {load_info}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pipeline()
```

---

## Dependency Management Switch

**User:** let's use poetry

**Claude:** Switched from pip to Poetry for dependency management

### Actions Taken:

1. **Initialize Poetry project:**
   ```bash
   poetry init --no-interaction --name zwift-scout --dependency dlt[duckdb] --dependency httpx
   ```
   - dlt version: ^1.17.0
   - httpx version: ^0.28.1

2. **Fix Python version constraint:**
   - Issue: Python ^3.12 incompatible with dlt requirement (<3.15,>=3.9.2)
   - Solution: Updated `pyproject.toml` to `python = ">=3.12,<3.15"`

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   - Installed 45 packages including dlt, httpx, duckdb, and all dependencies

---

## Testing Phase

### Task 4: Test the pipeline
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Command:**
```bash
poetry run python zwift_scout/zr_riders_pipeline.py
```

**Result:**
```
Pipeline completed: Pipeline zwift_riders load step completed in 0.18 seconds
1 load package(s) were loaded to destination duckdb and into dataset zr_raw
The duckdb destination used duckdb:////home/robgriffin247/vibe_code/./data/raw.duckdb location to store data
Load package 1759308455.704154 is LOADED and contains no failed jobs
```

**Verification:**
- Database created: `./data/raw.duckdb` (2.1MB)
- Dataset name: `zr_raw`
- Test rider IDs successfully loaded: 4598636, 5574, 5879996

## Creating Analytics Database with dbt

**User:** great, now create the analytics database with staging, intermediate and core schema. Note that power__w is power in watts, power__wkg is watts/kg; watts and wkg are suitable in column names there, and the number associated with them is the duration in seconds. Phenotype__scores__sprinter for example can just become sprinter_score

**Claude:** Created complete dbt project with three-layer architecture.

### Actions Taken:

1. **Added dbt-duckdb dependency:**
   ```bash
   poetry add dbt-duckdb
   ```
   - Installed dbt-core 1.10.13 and dbt-duckdb 1.9.6 with 40 dependencies

2. **Created dbt project structure:**
   - `dbt_project/dbt_project.yml` - Project configuration with three schema layers
   - `dbt_project/profiles.yml` - DuckDB connection config with attached raw database
   - Directory structure: `models/staging/`, `models/intermediate/`, `models/core/`

3. **Staging Layer (`stg_riders.sql`):**
   - Reads from attached `raw.zr_raw.riders` table
   - Sets proper data types with casting
   - Coalesces variant columns (e.g., `weight`, `weight__v_double`)
   - Renames columns to clean format:
     - `power__wkg5` → `watts_kg_5s`
     - `power__w60` → `watts_60s`
     - `phenotype__scores__sprinter` → `sprinter_score`
     - `race__current__rating` → `current_rating`
     - `handicaps__profile__flat` → `handicap_flat`
   - All 64 columns cleaned and renamed
   - Materialized as view in `main_staging` schema

4. **Intermediate Layer (`int_riders.sql`):**
   - Converts `_dlt_load_id` to human-readable timestamp (`loaded_at`)
   - Calculates `ftp_per_kg` metric
   - Converts Unix timestamps to datetime:
     - Race dates (`last_race_at`, `current_race_at`, etc.)
     - Expiration dates
   - Calculates performance percentages:
     - `win_rate_pct`
     - `podium_rate_pct`
     - `dnf_rate_pct`
   - Materialized as view in `main_intermediate` schema

5. **Core/Production Layer (`riders.sql`):**
   - Selects most important columns for BI/consumption
   - Includes:
     - Identity (rider_id, name, gender, country, etc.)
     - Performance (category, ftp, ftp_per_kg)
     - Key power metrics (5s, 60s, 300s in both watts and watts/kg)
     - Current racing status and 30-day peak
     - Race statistics with calculated percentages
     - Rider type and phenotype scores
     - Terrain handicaps
     - Club information
   - Materialized as table in `main_core` schema

### Configuration Details:

**profiles.yml:**
```yaml
zwift_scout:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: duckdb
      path: ../data/analytics.duckdb
      schema: main
      attach:
        - path: ../data/raw.duckdb
          alias: raw
```

**dbt_project.yml:**
```yaml
models:
  zwift_scout:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: staging
    intermediate:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: intermediate
    core:
      +materialized: table
      +schema: core
```

### Test & Verification:

**dbt debug:** ✅ All checks passed

**dbt run:** ✅ Completed successfully
```
1 of 3 OK created sql view model main_staging.stg_riders
2 of 3 OK created sql view model main_intermediate.int_riders

```

**Database verification:**
- Created: `./data/analytics.duckdb` (524KB)
- Schemas: `main_core`, `main_intermediate`, `main_staging`
- Core table: `riders` with 3 rows

**Sample data from main_core.riders:**

## Creating Streamlit Dashboard

**User:** could you give me the riders table in a streamlit app and run the app please, use wide display in the app config

**Claude:** Created and launched a Streamlit dashboard to display the riders data.

### Actions Taken:

1. **Added dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry add streamlit pandas
   ```
   - streamlit 1.50.0
   - pandas 2.3.3
   - numpy 2.3.3

2. **Created `streamlit_app.py`:**
   - Wide layout configuration
   - Page title: "Zwift Scout - Riders"
   - Metrics row showing:
     - Total Riders
     - Average FTP
     - Average FTP/kg
     - Total Races
   - Full riders table with all 46 columns
   - Data cached for performance

3. **Launched app:**
   - Running in background (shell ID: ee9250)
   - Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   - Network URL: http://172.25.198.173:8501

**App Features:**
- Wide layout for better table viewing
- Summary metrics at the top
- Interactive dataframe with sorting/filtering
- 600px height table view
- Caching for fast data loads

## Adding Club Endpoint and Filters

**User:** great, now build for the club endpoint, test with club 20650, add it to the databases and get the data into the core riders table along with the existing data (merge riders to their most recent load), then present them in the streamlit app. Also add the ability to filter the data to selected rider(s), both on ID and name

**Claude:** Created club pipeline, updated dbt models to merge by most recent load, and added filters to Streamlit app.

### Actions Taken:

1. **Created club pipeline (`zwift_scout/zr_club_pipeline.py`):**
   - GET endpoint: `https://zwift-ranking.herokuapp.com/public/clubs/{club_id}`
   - Uses merge disposition with `rider_id` as primary key
   - Extracts riders array from club response
   - Default club ID: 20650

2. **Tested club pipeline:**
   ```bash
   poetry run python zwift_scout/zr_club_pipeline.py
   ```
   - Successfully loaded 38 riders from club 20650
   - Merged into `zr_raw.riders` table in raw.duckdb
   - Note: Fixed endpoint from `/club/` to `/clubs/` (404 error)

3. **Updated dbt staging model (`stg_riders.sql`):**
   - Added CTE to identify most recent load per rider:
     ```sql
     most_recent as (
         select rider_id, max(_dlt_load_id) as latest_load_id
         from source
         group by rider_id
     )
     ```
   - Filters to only latest records per rider
   - Ensures no duplicate riders in final output

4. **Ran dbt models:**
   ```bash
   cd dbt_project && poetry run dbt run --profiles-dir .
   ```
   - All 3 models passed: staging, intermediate, core
   - Final rider count in `main_core.riders`: 38 riders
   - Successfully merged old (3 riders) and new (35 riders) from club

5. **Updated Streamlit app with filters:**
   - Added sidebar with two multiselect filters:
     - **Filter by Rider ID**: Dropdown of all rider IDs (sorted)
     - **Filter by Name**: Dropdown of all rider names (sorted)
   - Filters work independently or together
   - Metrics update based on filtered data
   - Caption shows: "Showing X of Y riders"
   - App automatically reloaded with new filters

**Results:**
- Raw database: 38 riders total (merged by rider_id)
- Analytics database: 38 riders in core (deduplicated by most recent load)
- Streamlit: Interactive filtering by ID and/or name
- App URL: http://localhost:8501

**Key Technical Details:**
- dlt merge disposition prevents duplicates at load time
- dbt staging layer ensures only most recent load per rider
- Streamlit filters are cached and performant
- All rider data from club 20650 now available

---

## Fixing Filter Logic

**User:** right now, the filters conflict with each other, e.g. filtering on 5574 in id and name Rob Griffin returns no rows when it should return 2 (rider 5574 and 4598636); i need to be able to filter on simultaneously

**Claude:** Fixed the filter logic to use OR instead of AND.

### Issue:
- Filters were using AND logic: `(rider_id IN filter) AND (name IN filter)`
- This meant both conditions had to match the same row
- Example: Selecting ID 5574 AND name "Rob Griffin" returned 0 rows (no single row matches both)

### Solution:
Changed to OR logic: `(rider_id IN filter) OR (name IN filter)`

**Code update in `streamlit_app.py`:**
```python
# Apply filters with OR logic (union of both filters)
if rider_id_filter or name_filter:
    # Create masks for each filter
    id_mask = df['rider_id'].isin(rider_id_filter) if rider_id_filter else pd.Series([False] * len(df))
    name_mask = df['name'].isin(name_filter) if name_filter else pd.Series([False] * len(df))

    # Combine with OR logic
    combined_mask = id_mask | name_mask
    filtered_df = df[combined_mask]
```

**Result:**
- Selecting ID 5574 + name "Rob Griffin" now returns 2 riders (ID 5574 Tim Hanson + ID 4598636 Rob Griffin)
- Filters work independently or together
- Union of both filter selections
